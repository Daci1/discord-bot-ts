# Discord Music Bot with discord-js

This is a Discord Music Bot written with discord-js. It supports various music commands to
play and manage songs in a voice channel.

## Commands

Here is a list of available commands:

- `/play` <song>: This command will play the specified song in the voice channel. The bot will search for the song on
  YouTube and play the first result.
- `/nowplaying`: This command will display information about the song that is currently playing.
- `/loop <mode>`: This command will turn on the given loop mode.
- `/skip`: This command will skip the current song and play the next song in the queue.
- `/stop`: This command will stop the current song, clear the queue and leave voice channel.
- `/clearqueue`: This command will stop the current song and clear the queue.
- `/pause`: This command will pause the current song.

### Important when using commands

Note that all commands should be used as slash commands and not send as messages to a text channel.

## How to use

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain the application token.
3. Add the bot to your Discord server.

### Development Setup
- Make sure you have Node.js 24 installed on your machine.
- Make a copy of `.env.example`, name it `.env` and fill out the env vars:
  - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: Go to Discord Developer > Application > Select your application > Bot > Token
  - DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: Go to Discord Developer > Application > Select your application > General Information > Application ID
- Install the required dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript by running:
  ```bash
  npm run compile
  ```
- Start the bot locally by running:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  
### !!! Deploying commands !!!
This implementation uses Discord's slash commands, which must be deployed via the Discord REST API to appear when you type `/` in the Discord chat.
The deployment script runs automatically when you use the bot via `Docker`, so you may skip this step if you are not developing locally.

- To deploy the commands manually, run the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:commands
  ```

Disclaimer: this may take up to 1 hour.
