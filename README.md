# Discord Music Bot with discord-js

This is a Discord Music Bot written with discord-js. It supports various music commands to
play and manage songs in a voice channel.

## Commands

Here is a list of available commands:

* `/play` <song>: This command will play the specified song in the voice channel. The bot will search for the song on
  YouTube and play the first result.
* `/nowplaying`: This command will display information about the song that is currently playing.
* `/loop <mode>`: This command will turn on the given loop mode.
* `/skip`: This command will skip the current song and play the next song in the queue.
* `/stop`: This command will stop the current song, clear the queue and leave voice channel.
* `/clearqueue`: This command will stop the current song and clear the queue.
* `/pause`: This command will pause the current song.

### Important when using commands

Note that all commands should be used as slash commands and not send as messages to a text channel.
